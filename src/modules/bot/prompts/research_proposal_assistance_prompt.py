        4. **Offer examples and templates**: Provide examples or outlines to help the user understand how to structure their proposal.
        5. **Recommend resources**: If applicable, suggest relevant research papers from arXiv to support their proposal.

        <context>
        {context}
        </context>

        !!! INSTRUCTIONS:
